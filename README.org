* Hi.

** I'm assuming you have the following environmental variables:

1. PIPEDRIVE_TOKEN, I usually leave it on .envrc. I never put any security-risk important env vars on my shell.nix file
2. PIPEDRIVE_ORG,
3. PG_CONN

** PG db schema:

1. user - user_login, user_id
2. session - session_id, timestamp
3. gist - gist_id, raw_url_link, user_id
4. gist_sess - session_id, gist_id

** Queries:

1. Is user in db?
2. Is gist in db?
3. Last added gists

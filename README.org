* Hi.

** I'm assuming you have the following environmental variables:

1. PIPEDRIVE_TOKEN
2. PIPEDRIVE_ORG
3. POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING

** PG db schema:

1. user - user_login, user_id
2. session - session_id, timestamp
3. gist - gist_id, raw_url_link, user_id
4. gist_sess - session_id, gist_id

** Queries:

1. Is user in db?
2. Is gist in db?
3. Last added gists

** Cluster ip: 35.228.33.46

** Cloud stuff:
- Private Artifact Registry for the images
- Stackdriver for all GKE logging
- GKE, hardened instance, load balancer, liveliness probe, readiness probe, 3 nodes, 12 gb ram, europe-north1-a
